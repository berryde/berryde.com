# Personal portfolio

My personal portfolio website, hosted [here](https://deb1g19.github.io/). The site is built in HTML with TailwindCSS - for a static single page site such as this there is no need for more complexity; a larger bundle will decrease performance with limited increase to user experience.

Feel free to use it as a template for your own portfolio site if you like it!
