# Personal portfolio

My personal portfolio website, hosted [here](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~deb1g19/). The site is built in static HTML with TailwindCSS - for an SPA such as this there is really no need for anything more complex as a larger bundle will decrease performance.

## Resources used

- [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
