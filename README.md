# Personal portfolio

My personal portfolio website, hosted [here](https://deb1g19.github.io/). The site is built in static HTML with TailwindCSS - for an SPA such as this there is really no need for anything more complex as a larger bundle will decrease performance.

Feel free to use it as a template for your own portfolio site if you like it!
