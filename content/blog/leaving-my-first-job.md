# Leaving My First Job

Tomorrow, October 1st, I start a new role as a Software Engineer at [Helsing](https://helsing.ai/). I’ve made this move to contribute directly to European defence efforts at the intersection of artificial intelligence and software for government. Since I joined Palantir just over two years ago, the geopolitical landscape has changed dramatically, particularly due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and its implications for Europe’s security.

When I first started university, moving to the US was a common aspiration among students. Higher salaries, vibrant cities, and the opportunity to live within the world’s largest economy made it an attractive goal. In fact, one reason I joined an American company after graduation was the possibility of relocating there myself. In recent months, though, I’ve noticed a clear shift in sentiment among my peers. Based on anecdotal evidence from conversations I've had recently, for many the US no longer carries the same pull it once did: political issues, security concerns and practical barriers such as the fact that [sponsoring an H1B visa now costs employers around $100,000](https://www.ft.com/content/c51fc02c-0859-4908-9c3d-c3c1d12550c4) have all played a role in this change.

These factors, combined with my curiosity to see what great engineering practices can look like across different organisations, made the decision to join Helsing feel like the right step for me at this time. The outcomes of their work directly affect the lives and futures of people I care about. They are a small, tightly knit group of exceptionally talented individuals working on problems I believe are critically important. It’s a privilege to be joining them, and I’m looking forward to picking up new tools, ideas, and concepts to apply in my work.

That said, this was never going to be an easy decision to make. My time at Palantir was incredibly rewarding. I led a small, fast-moving team focused on Developer Experience within Foundry. Developer Experience is a space I find deeply interesting and have spent a lot of time thinking about (see, for example, my dissertation project [Acecoder](https://github.com/berryde/acecoder)). I was one of the highest-output engineers in the organisation, and staying would have offered a stable, comfortable path working with fantastic people on fascinating problems. I loved working there and would wholeheartedly recommend it to others. In fact, I’d happily consider returning at some point in the future if the opportunity arose. Everyone I spoke with was very understanding of my decision, and although this next step is exciting, daunting and risky, I’m confident it’s the right move for me.

At this stage in my career, I want to spend as much time as possible being the least experienced person in the room. That’s how I’ll maximise my learning rate, build organisation-agnostic skills, and figure out the environments and characteristics of organisations that allow me to do my best work!
